# OCN 479 - blinkLED

Person 1: Create a GitHub repository for your LED blinking code from last class. Commit your code and push it to the main branch of the repository.

Person 2: Fork the repository created by Person 1. Create a branch called "SOS." Begin working on (i.e., "check out" that branch). Change the code to make the LED blink out an "SOS" signal. Look up Morse code if needed. (Hint: there may be example code out there on the web already; you would likely have to modify it for your microcontroller, but may not have to write all of it yourself). Commit changes to your new branch as appropriate. Once the SOS code is fully functional, create a Pull Request (PR) on the original repository.

Person 1: Review the PR and merge it into your main repository's main branch if appropriate.
